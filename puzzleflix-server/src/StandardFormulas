Calculating levels:

    XP to reach a certain level:
        xp = 0.875*(level^2)+2.125*(level)

    Get level from total XP:
        level = (- 17 + sqrt(224*totalXP + 289)) / 14

Milestone Unlocks:
    lvl 1  ( 3 xp    ) - ability to create puzzles unlocked
    lvl 5  (~33 xp   ) - primary colour banners
    lvl 10 (~109 xp  ) - gradient banners 
    lvl 15 (~228 xp  ) - pattern banners (colour selectable?) 
    lvl 20 (~393 xp  ) - gold banner
    lvl 25 ( 600 xp  ) - gold gradient banner

Notes:
    The max level would be 25, which requires 600 total xp (~completing 200 hard puzzles)
    If level cap is increased then lvl40 would be 1495 xp 

    Hard puzzles can award 3xp or 2xp with 1 hint used (0xp for any more hints).
    Medium puzzles award 2xp or 1xp with 1 hint (0xp for any more hints).
    Easy puzzles award 1xp (0xp if hint used).

    Replaying levels should award 0xp.

    Bonus xp can be awarded, perhaps for completing in a faster than average time o leaving a review
